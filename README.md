## About

The repository containts the software used by the AGH team during the ANHIR challenge organized jointly with the IEEE ISBI 2019 conference.
The purpose of the repository is to make the results fully reproducible.

## Example

The example how to use the code is presented in files:
* [Example Single Pair](https://github.com/lNefarin/ANHIR_MW/blob/master/example.py)
* [Example All Pairs](https://github.com/lNefarin/ANHIR_MW/blob/master/example_all.py)

## Dataset

For the dataset access and full description please visit [ANHIR Webiste](https://anhir.grand-challenge.org/Data/).

## Dependencies

* NumPy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* OpenCV (contrib)
* SimpleITK
* Pandas

## Limitations

The software was tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Python version >=3.5.x. The current version will not work correctly on Windows operating system.
